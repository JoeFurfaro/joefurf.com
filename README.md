My website for personal introduction, career portfolio, and blog. It is a simple React app with no backend, so you can run and build it in seconds with Node or Bun.

```bash
cd bun

# To launch with Bun
bun install
bun run dev

# To launch with Node
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also build for production with the `build` script.

```bash
cd bun && bun run build
```
